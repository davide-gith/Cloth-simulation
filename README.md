# ðŸ‘• Cloth Simulation
This repository implements a **cloth simulator** built in C++ and OpenGL, combining both **physically-based** and **position-based** simulation techniques.  
The cloth interacts with a variety of colliders, including **spheres**, **boxes**, **capsules**, **swept-sphere lines**, and **swept-sphere triangles**, allowing the study of complex fabric dynamics in different scenarios.
